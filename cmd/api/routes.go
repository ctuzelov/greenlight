	// Fortunately, httprouter allows us to set our own custom error handlers when we initialize
	// the router. These custom handlers must satisfy the http.Handler interface, which is good
	// news for us because it means we can easily re-use the notFoundResponse() and
	// methodNotAllowedResponse() helpers that we just made.
